## Features:
1. **Playmode**

### What is new:
2. **Custom Build Mode**  
   You can now specify the width and height in the file `main.cpp`.  (I hope to implement this in the GUI soon).  
   I created this because I had a university seminar where I needed to give a presentation with detailed explanations, and I needed to build some custom tetris boards. I couldn’t find any online tool to meet my needs.  
   I hope this feature will be beneficial for others as well.

   Contributions are welcome!

## Requirements:
- **Raylib Library**  
   Here is Nick’s video on how to install it:

- **VS Code**  
   Use VS Code to run the code easily, or you can link the classes in your own way.

**PS:** The project is still not well-documented, but I will try to improve this as soon as possible.
